"""Wheel compilation: drive the build backend, then tag the result.

`build_wheel` is a thin wrapper over PEP 517 (`build.ProjectBuilder`), and
`build_package` is the end-to-end pipeline that most callers want:

    inspect -> scaffold -> stage -> build -> retag

`build_packages` runs that once per binary for a whole directory, sharing one
name and version across the set. Its job beyond the loop is to refuse a batch
that cannot succeed *before* any of it runs, since a failure half way through
leaves finished wheels in the output directory that nothing will clean up.
