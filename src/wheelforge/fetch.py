"""Fetch release assets from GitHub, verified against their checksums.

`build` needs an executable on disk, and getting one is nearly always the same
four steps: find the release, pick the wanted assets out of the twenty or
thirty it publishes, check them against a digest, and unpack them. Doing that
by hand is where the mistakes happen, because the two worst outcomes both look
exactly like success -- an unverified download, and a pattern that quietly
matched nothing.

Talking to the API directly rather than shelling out to `gh` keeps
`uvx wheelforge` self-contained: a public release needs no credentials at all.
A token is read from `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` when one is set, for private
repositories and for the larger rate limit. As with the publish token, there is
deliberately no option for it, so it cannot reach a shell history.

Verification prefers the digest the API reports per asset, which GitHub
computes itself on upload. Assets published before mid-2025 have none, so a
checksum file in the same release is the fallback, in either convention found
in the wild: a bare digest in `<asset>.sha256`, or `SHA256SUMS`-style rows of
`<digest>  <name>`. Neither is a signature. Both attest that these are the
bytes that were uploaded, not who uploaded them.

Nothing here is on the build path, and `build` never reaches out to the
network. Fetching is a separate step that happens to end where building starts.
